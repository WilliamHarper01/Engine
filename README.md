# Engine

## Introduction

## Compiling the Engine

1. Install CMake, I would recommend using the CMake-GUI for an easier experience compiling.

2. Clone the repository.

3. Inside the repo, pull the dependencies using "git submodule update --init".

4. Create a new directory called "Build", and run CMake with the source being the root diectory, and the build

location being the Build directory. Specify the generator you want to compile with (Ex. Visual Studio, Makefile).

5. Once the project is configured and generated, compile the code using the generator you specified.
